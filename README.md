# AppStoreClone
This project is a clone of AppStore . Converted to Swift3 syntax (Courtesy: https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/). It covers topics like:

1) Layout structure of the application by using a UICollectionView which allows for horizontal scrolling for each category section of apps.
2) Integrating JSON data from a REST api service.
3) Perform Segue programatically.
4) Using NSLayout Constraints through out the app.
5) No Storyboards used at all!
